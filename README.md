## Work in progress
##### If you are interested in helping form the Project Provisioning Protocol then Star the repo and keep your eyes on both this and the [Protocol Repo](https://github.com/LucasBullen/Project-Provisioning-Protocol)

 - PPP4J: Holds all the message structures and non-client dependent code
 - PPP4E: Holds the wizards and communication logic that is Eclipse dependent
 - PPP4PY: A python client to run servers from a command line interface
 - Rust: Server and Eclipse plugin for provisioning Cargo based Rust projects
 - Web: Server and Eclipse plugin for provisioning basic websites
 - OpenShift: Server and Eclipse plugin demonstraiting the launch.openshift.io process through the protocol

The structure, design, and locations of code are all subject to change quite often currently as these projects are in their beginning stages.
